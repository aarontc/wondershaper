Version 1.3.1 (forked by Jia Yuan Lo):
    - Tidied up and moved around all sorts of stuffs to make sense and look neat
    - Added experimental options to accept values in kiloBytes per second

Version 1.3 (forked by Saimonn/Camptocamp):
    - Moved from CBQ to HTB queing. CBQ didn't cope well on a ~100Mbps link:
      individual downloads were ceiling at 3Mbit/s.
      Moving to HTB allows to really use all the available bandwith,
      even with a single TCP connection,
      and without any caveats on SIP telephony or link reactivity.

Version 1.2 (forked by magnic0):
    - Added command-line interface (through options and flags) that didn't seem
      to be working before as the options were hardcoded in the script.
    - systemd .service and .conf file by kfgz and cmsigler at aur.archlinux.org

Version 1.1:
    - Georg Wild <georg.wild@gmx.de> noticed that NOPRIOHOSTDST was never used

Version 1.0:
    - We now prioritize ALL small packets, not just acks
    - Ability to deprioritize certain source/dst host/ports
